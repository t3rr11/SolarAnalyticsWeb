# SolarAnalyticsWeb

This will be the webview for my solar analytics. These graphs are in development and are by no means final. Still much more to add, but currently it just grabs the data and displays it in pretty graphs. With inveral changing buttons to smooth out clouds, or get more accurate minute to minute data.
